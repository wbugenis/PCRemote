# PCRemote
This is an Android app that allows the user to control their computer's mouse and keyboard from their phone.
It runs via bluetooth in conjunction with the PCRemoteServer application.

It still needs a bit of work, it will crash upon startup if bluetooh is not enabled, and currently requires the user to manually input their MAC address. The PCRemoteServer tray icon will show your computer's mac address when you right click it.
